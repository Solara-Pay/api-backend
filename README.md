# Welcome to the Solara Pay API & Backend

This repository houses the core API and Payroll Scheduling System of **Solara Pay**, a platform designed to automate payroll disbursement for businesses. Our API handles the management of the database and powers our robust scheduling system, ensuring seamless, timely salary payments to employees.

## About Solara Pay API & Backend
- **Database Management**: Centralized management of business data, payroll groups, employee records, and payroll scheduling.
- **Payroll Scheduling System**: Automatically disburses salaries based on configured schedules (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly). Ensures payments are made on time using Solana's blockchain technology.

## Important Repositories
To get the complete Solara Pay experience, we recommend checking out the following repositories:

1. **[Solara Pay Web Interface](https://github.com/Solara-Pay/web)**
   The user interface for managing payrolls, adding employees, and scheduling payments.

2. **[Solara Pay Next Backend](https://github.com/Solara-Pay/next-backend)**
   This handles wallet generation and transaction processing using the Solana blockchain, enabling secure and fast payments.

## How It Works
- **Automated Payroll**: Once a business schedules payroll, our system automatically deducts funds from the company's on-site wallet and disburses salaries to employees' Solana wallets based on the set schedule.
- **Cross-Border Support**: Pay employees anywhere in the world without worrying about geographical limitations.
